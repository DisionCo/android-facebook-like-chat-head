# Android facebook chatheads behavior
ChatHeads is a new feature in Facebook Messenger app where little bubbles appear in the Android app when somebody sends you a message. It's a nice little feature and uses very cool animations.

This project shows you how to re-implement this feature and to figure out how the animations are done.
